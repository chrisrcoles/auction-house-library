Coding Problem

Given an array of unsorted positive integers, write a function that
finds runs of 3 consecutive numbers (ascending or descending) and
returns the indices where such runs begin. If no such runs are found,
return null.

function findConsecutiveRuns(input:Array):Array

Example:  [1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 9, 8, 9, 10, 11, 7]
would return [0, 4, 6, 7]
